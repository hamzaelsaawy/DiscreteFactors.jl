# Factors

Implements a generalized version of factors 
([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_elimination),
 [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_graph)) that map the all possible
instances of a set of dimensions onto a single output without explicitly
having to enumerate all the possible dimension value combinations
